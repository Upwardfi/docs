<p>Highline&#39;s API are rate limited to prevent abuse that would degrade our ability to maintain consistent API performance for all users. By default, each API key or app is rate limited at 10,000 requests per hour. If your requests are being rate limited, HTTP response code 429 will be returned with an rate_limit_exceeded error.</p>
